    "answer_cot": "To determine the number of large barrels needed to hold 95 tons of oil while minimizing the number of barrels used and ensuring that every barrel is fully occupied, we can use a combination of large and small barrels.\n\nLet x be the number of large barrels used and y be the number of small barrels used. Then we have the following system of equations:\n\n6x + 5y = 95 (total amount of oil needed to be stored)\nx + y = total number of barrels used\n\nTo minimize the number of barrels used, we want to minimize x + y. We can solve for y in terms of x from the first equation:\n\n5y = 95 - 6x\ny = (95 - 6x)/5\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx + (95 - 6x)/5 = total number of barrels used\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5, we get:\n\n5x + 95 - 6x = 5 * total number of barrels used\n-x + 95 = 5 * total number of barrels used\ntotal number of barrels used = (95 - x)/5\n\nTo minimize the number of barrels used, we want to minimize (95 - x)/5. This is minimized when x is maximized, since x represents the number of large barrels used. The largest integer value of x that satisfies the equation is x = 15, which gives y = 4. Therefore, we need 15 large barrels and 4 small barrels to store 95 tons of oil while minimizing the number of barrels used and ensuring that every barrel is fully occupied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <15>.",

    "answer_cot": "The first 2500 minutes of use are free, so we only need to calculate the cost for the minutes over 2500. \n\nLet's start by subtracting the cost of the free minutes from the total bill: \n\n112.45 dollars - 49.95 dollars = 62.50 dollars \n\nThis means that the cell phone was charged 62.50 dollars for the minutes over 2500. \n\nWe know that each minute over 2500 costs 0.25 dollars, so we can divide the total charge by the cost per minute to find the number of minutes over 2500: \n\n62.50 dollars ÷ 0.25 dollars per minute = 250 minutes \n\nTherefore, the cell phone was in use for 250 minutes over the 2500 free minutes. \n\nTherefore, the answer is <250>.",

Since we don't know the initial number of candy bars, we can use algebra to solve for the difference:\n\nLet x be the initial number of candy bars they both had.\nAfter Rick ate 11 candy bars, he would have x - 11 candy bars left.\nAfter Todd gave away 18 candy bars, he would have x - 18 candy bars left.\n\nTo find the difference, we can subtract Todd's number of candy bars from Rick's:\n\n(x - 11) - (x - 18) = 18 - 11\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n7 = 7\n\nThis means that the initial number of candy bars they both had doesn't matter, as long as they both had the same number.
